# PolygonJS

JavaScript 3D library where polygons are first class citizens.

## Guide

PolygonJS uses a right-hand coordinate system.

## 3D Primer

### Coordinate Systems

- **Object Space**
- **World Space** (Model Space)
- **Camera Space** (Eye / View Space)
- **Screen Space** (Clip Space)

#### World Transform Matrix (M)

Places objects within the world.

PolygonJS uses a **scene-graph** to define the heirarchy of objects in the world.

**Child**<sub>world</sub> = **Parent**<sub>world</sub> * **Child**<sub>local</sub>

**No parent**: **Child**<sub>world</sub> = **Child**<sub>local</sub>

#### Camera Transform Matrix (C)

Places the camera in the correct position (_eye_) and orientation in world space.

#### View Transform Matrix (V)

Matrix transforms vertices from world to view-space. This matrix is the **inverse** of the camera transform matrix (**Identity Matrix = VC**, or **V = C<sup>-1</sup>**). his is used to transform any object in the scene from world space into view space.

	This matrix is usually concatenated together with the objectâ€™s world matrix and the projection matrix so that vertices can be transformed from object-space directly to clip-space in the vertex program. [1]

```
MVP = P * V * M

v' = MVP * v
```

#### Projection Transform Matrix (P)

View-space to clip-space (final). **Orthographic** e.g. isometric or **Perspective**.
